# Chess Engine

I am creating this chess engine to measure its accuracy over time playing on chess.com. 

## Phase 1: Creating the board GUI on Android and adding basic chess rules
- As a user, I would like to be able to see a chess board as an android application on a phone.
- As a user, I would like to be able to see the markings for the ranks (rows) and files (columns) of the chess board.
- As a user, I would like to be able to see both black and white's chess pieces on the chess board.
- As a user, I would like to be able to move pieces (pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, the queen, and the king) 
  in accordance with standard piece movement rules.
- As a user, I would like to be able to capture another piece.
- As a user, I would like to be able to play a turn based game against myself with a single game view, with always white at the
  bottom and always black on top.
- As a user, I would like to be able to have my king be "checked" and "check" the opponent's king.
- As a user, I would like to castle if possible.
- As a user, I would like to capture a pawn "en passant" or have my pawn captured "en passant."
- As a user, I would like to be able to checkmate the opposing player and get checkmated if possible.
- As a user, I would like to be able to draw a game by "insufficient material."
